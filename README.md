### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Abir! I'm a senior at Stuyvesant High School. I code a lot of projects for my school and I also like taking photos in my free time. I'm still working on something cool to put in this preview but in the meantime please enjoy a random photo that was taken by me :)

You can find more like it at: [abir.photos](https://abir.photos)
